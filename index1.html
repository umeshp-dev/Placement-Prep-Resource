                <p class="ans">.HTML: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is how web pages are 'built'. It determines what
                    types of elements appear on the page, and where. CSS: This language is designed to be used alongside
                    a 'markup' language like HTML. CSS defines how HTML elements are formatted – controlling their
                    layout, colors, fonts, and so on.</p>

                    <p class="ans"> A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.We can divide CSS
                        selectors into five categories:
                        Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
                        ---Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
                        ---Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
                        ---Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
                        ---Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value).
                    </p>

                        </h3>
                        <p class="ans"> If there are two or more conflicting CSS rules that point to the same element,
                            the browser follows some rules to determine which one is most specific and therefore wins
                            out. Think of specificity as a score/rank that determines which style declarations are
                            ultimately applied to an element.</p>

                            <p class="ans"> A stacking context is created when an element is positioned and assigned a
                                z-index value other than auto , or when an element has an opacity value less than 1. In
                                WebKit and Chrome 22+ an element with a fixed position always creates a stacking
                                context, even when the z-index value is auto .

                                <p class="ans">An HTML attribute is a piece of markup language used to adjust the
                                    behavior or display of an HTML element. For example, attributes can be used to
                                    change the color, size, or functionality of HTML elements.</p>

                                    <p class="ans">A block formatting context is a part of a visual CSS rendering of a
                                        web page. It's the region in which the layout of block boxes occurs and in which

                                        <p class="ans"> Before Flex became popular (around 2014), the float-based grid
                                            system was the most reliable because it still has the most browser support
                                            among the alternative existing systems (flex, grid). Bootstrap was using the
                                            float approach until Bootstrap 4 which switched to the flex-based approach.
                                            As of writing (2020), flex is the recommended approach for building grid
                                            systems and has decent browser support.</p>
